# Netflix-clone-Frontend
This is a Project displaying the landing page of Netflix- A popular streaming platform.
A Netflix clone built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my web development learning journey. This project serves as a functional replica of the landing page of the popular streaming platform, complete with a responsive UI. It offers a great opportunity to practice and enhance my skills in front-end development.
I have also attached some of the preview images of the product here.
